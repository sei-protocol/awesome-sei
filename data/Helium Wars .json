  "description": "Helium Wars: Shaped By Players, Powered By Creators  The first-ever co-created tactical a hero shooter where players don’t just compete — they actively shape the experience itself. From cosmetics and maps to missions and storylines, the community builds the game as much as they play it. A living world that never goes stale because it evolves with its players. And no, it’s not another broken “play-to-earn” grindfest. Rewards flow to those who actually help the game thrive.",
